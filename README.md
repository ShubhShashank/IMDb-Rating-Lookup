# IMDb-Rating-Lookup
A python script that lets you check the IMDb rating, genre, cast etc of a movie with one click, without opening the brwoser.

Usage for Windows:
Download Tkinter and install Tkinter.
Download the Script and just drag and drop the movie file you want to look up the rating for.
(No need for renaming the file, it will handle that)
A dialog box will appear showing rating, genre, actor etc.
